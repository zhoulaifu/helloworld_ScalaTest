* What is this 

This is the (nearly) minimal setting for doing a text-book unit testing for
Scala. Below I list the commands so a pense-bete. Scala package `myPackage`
includes `MyLib.scala` that defines a function to test, and `MyTestSuite.scala`
that does the test; Two ScalaTest jar files are put into the repo for your
convenience.


I have intentionally avoided sbt, a complex beast. The commands below use only
`scalac` and `scala`. Type the commands from the directory where `myPackage` can be accessed witho

* How to compile

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
scalac -cp scalatest_2.12-3.0.5.jar:scalactic_2.12-3.0.5.jar myPackage/MyLib.scala myPackage/MyTestSuite.scala
#+END_EXAMPLE

* How to run the tests
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
scala -cp scalatest_2.12-3.0.5.jar:scalactic_2.12-3.0.5.jar org.scalatest.run myPackage.MyTestSuite
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Expected results
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Run starting. Expected test count is: 2
MyTestSuite:
- square(-1)=1
- square(0)=0
Run completed in 115 milliseconds.
Total number of tests run: 2
Suites: completed 1, aborted 0
Tests: succeeded 2, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
